          <li>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a programming language used by developers to define how webpage content is presented to users. It defines the colors, aesthetics, visual layout and organization</li>
          <li>A selector defines the element or attributes to which the rules or declarations apply </li>
          <li>Declarations contain two important components: The CSS property we want to apply and the value of the property</li>
          <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element.</li>
          <li>A padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element.</li>

        <h2>JavaScript</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>JavaScript (JS) is a high-level dynamic programming language that allows users to interact with websites. </li>
          <li>In JavaScript, to declare a variable, we use the "var" keyword. After the "var" keyword, we give the variable a name.</li>
          <li>A variable is a named container that allows us to store data in our code.</li>
          <li>This name must be unique because it is how we will reference the information stored in the variable in our code.</li>
          <li>We use an assignment operator "=" to assign the specific data that we want stored in our variable.</li>
          <li>The "topics" variable contains a "string" that includes all of the topics that we are studying in this module</li>
          <li>The word "console" refers to a test environment that developers use to check out their code</li>
          <li>The second part,".log()", is a method, which means a set of instructions that can be executed by a computer.</li>
          <li>We can use the "console.log" method to output a message to the web console by adding an argument</li>
          <li>Control flow is the order in which a computer executes code in a script.</li>
          <li>In JavaScript, code runs from the first statement at the top of the page, down to the last statement at the bottom of the page</li>
          <li>Control flow can be interrupted, however. We can use conditional statements and loops to control the order in which code is executed, or if it is even executed at all.</li>
          <li>When the computer encounters an "if" statement in a JavaScript file, it will check to see if the condition that we provide is truthy</li>
          <li>If it is, then it will do whatever action we ask it to do in between the curly brackets</li>
          <li>If the condition isnt true or has a value that isnt truthy, then the computer will ignore whatever is in between the curly brackets and move on</li>
          <li>In JavaScript, we can have more than one condition by using “else if”</li>
          <li>An array is a single variable that is used to hold a group of data. Arrays are typically used to hold data that is related in some way</li>
